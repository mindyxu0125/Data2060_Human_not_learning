    "#### 0.1 Overview  \n",
    "The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm is a nonparametric supervised learning method that builds a binary decision tree for classification tasks. At each step, the algorithm selects a feature and threshold that create two child nodes with lower class impurity, using criteria such as Gini impurity or entropy. Through this recursive partitioning, CART represents the classifier as a set of piecewise-constant regions, where each leaf corresponds to a predicted class label. Because the sequence of splits directly mirrors the decision-making process, CART offers a transparent and intuitive model structure."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### 0.2 Advantages  \n",
    "CART offers several notable strengths that contribute to its widespread use as a baseline classifier. First, the model is highly interpretable: each internal node corresponds to a clear “if–then” condition based on a single feature, allowing the entire decision path to be easily traced and communicated. This transparency is particularly valuable in settings where model explanations are required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, CART is able to capture nonlinear relationships and feature interactions without relying on explicit transformations or parametric assumptions. Its recursive splitting procedure enables the model to adapt flexibly to irregular or complex decision boundaries, providing expressive power beyond that of linear models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, CART requires minimal preprocessing. It can accommodate both numerical and categorical variables, is robust to monotonic feature scaling, and implicitly performs feature selection by choosing splits only on informative variables. These characteristics make CART convenient to implement and reliable across a wide range of practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 0.3 Disadvantages  \n",
    "Despite its advantages, CART also presents several limitations that must be considered. Most importantly, the model is prone to overfitting when allowed to grow without constraints. As emphasized in the bias–complexity trade-off discussed in the course reading, increasing model flexibility reduces approximation error but raises estimation error, causing deep, unpruned trees to exhibit high variance and poor generalization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "CART also tends to be unstable: small perturbations in the training data can alter early splits, resulting in substantially different tree structures. This sensitivity undermines the model’s reliability, especially in contexts requiring stable predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because CART relies exclusively on axis-aligned splits, it may need many successive partitions to approximate diagonal or curved decision boundaries, leading to unnecessarily deep and complex trees. These shortcomings motivate the use of pruning techniques and more advanced ensemble methods, such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, which address variance and stability issues more effectively.\n"
